-  Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @Sid-the-Slothh
- Iâ€™m interested in all sorts of programming concepts. Right now, I am looking into competitive programming and designing algorithms. I started working on Leetcode a couple months ago, and I will continue to until I master basic algorithm design :) 
- I'm also going to dabble in ML and knowledge based systems once I get around to it.
- Iâ€™m currently learning python and C++
- Iâ€™m not currently looking to collaborate, but any feedback on posted projects would be valued greatly :D
- How to reach me : Discord: Sid #2281
